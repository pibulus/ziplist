## Remaining Tasks

### Icon and Asset Generation
- ⏳ Install Sharp and SVG Export libraries: `npm install sharp svgexport`
- ⏳ Run the icon generation script: `node scripts/generate-pwa-icons.js`
- ⏳ Run the splash screen generation script: `node scripts/generate-splash-screens.js`
- ⏳ Create PWA screenshots for the app store listings

### PWA Testing
- ⏳ Test installation on iOS devices
- ⏳ Test installation on Android devices
- ⏳ Test installation on desktop browsers (Chrome, Edge)
- ⏳ Verify offline functionality works properly
- ⏳ Test transcription counting and prompt thresholds
- ⏳ Test installation flow across platforms
- ⏳ Run Lighthouse PWA audit and address any issues

### Final Validation
- ⏳ Verify all icons load correctly on different platforms
- ⏳ Test app launch from home screen
- ⏳ Verify splash screens appear on iOS devices
- ⏳ Ensure offline experience is user-friendly
- ⏳ Check that the service worker correctly caches assets
- ⏳ Verify the peach gradient ghost icon appears properly on home screens

## Asset Generation Instructions

We've prepared scripts to generate all necessary PWA assets:

### PWA Icons

1. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   npm install sharp svgexport
   ```

2. Run the icon generation script:
   ```bash
   node scripts/generate-pwa-icons.js
   ```

3. This will generate:
   - All PWA icons in various sizes in `/static/icons/`
   - Regular icons with the ghost on peach gradient
   - Maskable icons with safe zones for Android
   - Theme-aware icons for light/dark mode

### iOS Splash Screens

1. Run the splash screen generation script:
   ```bash
   node scripts/generate-splash-screens.js
   ```

2. This will generate:
   - All iOS splash screens in `/static/splash/`
   - Sized appropriately for all iOS device variations
   - Featuring the TalkType ghost centered on a peach gradient

### Source Files

The icon system uses these source files:
- `/static/assets/talktype-icon-base.svg` - Ghost outline
- `/static/assets/talktype-icon-eyes.svg` - Ghost eyes
- `/static/talktype-icon-bg-gradient.svg` - Peach gradient background
- Other gradient variations: `-mint.svg`, `-bubblegum.svg`, `-rainbow.svg`
