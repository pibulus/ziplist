// WHY THIS EXISTS: every silent-stale-deploy incident in this fleet had the
// same shape — the host reported success and served an old build, and nothing
// could tell the difference from outside. `fleet-check --deployed` was written
// to catch exactly that and had to print `unknown` for the Netlify and Deno
// lanes, because neither host exposes the commit it is currently serving.
//
// The past attempt tried to ASK THE HOST and gave up. This inverts it: the
// build stamps itself, so the artifact answers for itself over plain HTTP on
// any host, in any lane, forever.
//
// This is strictly better than the host API even where one exists — a Netlify
// CLI artifact upload (`netlify deploy --prod`, the lane used whenever build
// credits are exhausted) has a NULL commit_ref in Netlify's own API. The host
// genuinely does not know. The stamp does.
//
// Runs from `prebuild`, so it cannot be forgotten on a build path.
