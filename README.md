## Why This Exists

Lists shouldn't be boring. Voice input shouldn't be frustrating. Apps shouldn't treat you like a database.

This is for anyone who's ever stood in a store trying to remember what they needed, anyone who thinks better out loud, anyone who wants their tools to feel a little more human.

Clean, sweet, and stupidly easy. Because that's how software should be.
